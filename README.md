# bopl battle hitbox visualizer
A mod for bopl battle which draws lines around hitboxes. made by Jo912345.

# Notes
- As of version 3.0.0, rectangular hitboxes are now always drawn 100% accurately. In old versions the drawn hitbox edge extended half of the line thickness past the real hitbox edge, and the corners didn't quite connect.
- Circular hitboxes are and always were drawn accurately, no matter the line thickness.
- Shapes that are multi-colored are internally marked as active, and black and white if internally marked as disabled. (assuming a default color config).
- As of version 3.0.0, line colors can be modified in the config file.
