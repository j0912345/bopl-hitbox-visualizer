# bopl battle hitbox visualizer
A mod for bopl battle which draws lines around hitboxes. made by Jo912345.

# IMPORTANT NOTES
- The real hitbox of rectanlges is in the center of the lines drawn on screen. Higher line thicknesses thus will extend further from the real hitbox.
- The real hitboxes of circles are always drawn exactly, no matter the line thickness. Higher line thicknesses will have more inwards padding but won't extend past the real hitbox.
